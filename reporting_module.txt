============================================================================================================

After this need to 

go to kibana dashboard (https://kibana.zam-dev.mosip.net/app/management/data/index_management/indices)

check Index Management (Health (should :green, Size ) everything need to check.

Saved objects also.

----------------------------------------------------

Kafka dashboard also need to check (check kafka connect --> should come 20 Connectors)

In reporting ns --> 11 pods and 2 Jobs (if that jobs run then only 20 connectors will come otherwise it will not add)

I got one issue ---> postgres-password (in secrets) --> need to change to postgresql-password)

For kafka pods should up and running.

cattle-logging system (logging pods up and running) (if they use logging)

Issues faced:
============
I got storage issue in zam-dev env (logging pod and kafka uI pods are assigned to node6) because of storage it went unavailable.

Abhi increased the resources it came up and running.

reporting install.sh is not executed and init jobs are not executed.. so connectors were not showing.. I did ./delete.sh and redeployed..
