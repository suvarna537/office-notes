First I need to login (ssh into wireguard rancher )  and add assigned.txt, cd peer12/ nano peer12.conf

go to normal keycloak and add user

https://keycloak.unraf-pilot.mosip.net/auth/admin/master/console/#/realms/master/users


then go to rancher and add cluster and project members -->  search username with local add owner -->

then check keycloak user and add.


#for giving wg access and rancher access and adding keycloak user.
